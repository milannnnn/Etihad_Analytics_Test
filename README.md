## Etihad Analytics Test

This repository contains the code utilized for solving given analytics task. 

The analysis was carried out in Python 3 programming language. All utilized modules were listed in 'requirements.txt' file, and they can easily be installed with 'pip install requirements.txt' command.

For coding simplicity and maintability, the code was structured in a object-oriented style. All major code parts (data parsing, downloading, analysis and visualization) were coded into separate classes (found in folder 'src/'), which allowed the implementation of a super simple final script.

The obtained analysis results can be replicated by running the 'main.py' script (or 'main.ipynb' Jupyter notebook).
